# Industrial Health Monitor
Industrial Health Monitor is an IoT application that uses a combination of sensors and machine learning algorithms to predict and prevent potential failures in industrial machinery. By continuously monitoring the condition of the machinery, the app helps to minimize downtime, improve efficiency, and reduce maintenance costs.

# Features
•	Real-time monitoring of industrial machinery using temperature, vibration, pressure, current and proximity sensors
•	Alerts and notifications to the maintenance team when abnormal behavior is detected or potential failure is predicted

# Future plans
•	Predictive maintenance using machine learning algorithms to identify potential issues before they lead to breakdowns
•	Automatic scheduling of maintenance based on usage and condition of the machinery
